# Student Management System

## Description
In this project, you'll build a simple system that allows you to manage a list of students and their academic grades.

### Getting Started
Define two arrays:
- An array for storing student names.
- An array for storing their grades.

### Functions
Create functions to help manage these arrays:
- **Add a New Student and Grade:** A function to add a new student and their grade.
- **Display Students:** A function to display the list of students.
- **Calculate Average Grade:** A function to calculate the average of all students' grades.

### Usage of Loops
Use loops in different parts of the system:
- To display all students and their grades.
- To calculate the average grade.

### Error Handling
To ensure the system runs smoothly without issues, use exceptions to handle special cases:
- Avoid division by zero when calculating the average grade.
- Use `try-catch` to handle these exceptions and display appropriate error messages if needed.
